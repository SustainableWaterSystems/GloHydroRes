# GloHydroRes
The code in this repository is used to generate the GloHydroRes dataset and the figures featured in the associated paper.


# Description 
Analyzing the impacts requires detailed data on both hydropower plant attributes (e.g., type, installed capacity, head) and reservoir characteristics (e.g., area, depth, volume). However, current open-source datasets often lack integration, with plant datasets missing reservoir information and vice versa. GloHydroRes, a global dataset that bridges this gap by combining open-source hydropower plant and reservoir datasets.
